# DSA with Java

## Introduction

Welcome to the **DSA with Java** repository! This collection is designed to help you **learn, implement, and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java**. It includes well-structured code examples, explanations, and commonly asked interview problems to enhance your problem-solving skills and coding efficiency.

## Topics Covered

### Data Structures
1. **Arrays**
   - [1D Arrays](https://github.com/humhainpiyush/DSA-with-Java/tree/51e4e6fc759d713910764232f764043d5052fc5b/1D%20Array) *(Basic operations, searching, and manipulation)*
   - [2D Arrays](https://github.com/humhainpiyush/DSA-with-Java/tree/284a6cdad5823ca05955b6b813b901a4502f129b/2D%20Array) *(Matrix operations, prefix sum, and transformations)*
2. **Linked Lists** *(Coming Soon)*
3. **Stacks and Queues** *(Coming Soon)*
4. **Graphs and Trees** *(Coming Soon)*
